Liberty Station is a custom codebase of Space Station 14, which is a remake of SS13 that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), their homegrown engine written in C#.

## Documentation/Wiki

The SS14 [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.io/) has documentation on vanilla content, engine, game design and more. If you're new to SS14, it's a good starting point to get familiar with their engine.

## Contributing

Feel free to propose fun new shit, new maps, bugfixes, etc. but we'd prefer it if you didn't open a PR to try to add slimegirls back into the character creator.

## Building

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `RUN_THIS.py` to init submodules and download the engine.
3. Compile.

[More detailed instructions on building can be found at SS14's official website.](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup.html)
