Welcome to Space Station 14! You have just started your shift aboard a Nanotrasen space station. Cooperate with your fellow crewmates, perform your job to the best of your ability, and have fun.

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins.

Instead of intents, SS14 has a "combat mode." Check controls below for its keybind. You can't attack anybody with it off, so no more hitting yourself with your own crowbar.
